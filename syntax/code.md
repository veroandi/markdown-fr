# Code blocks

Pre-formatted Code blocks are used to write programming or highlight source code. More than a simple paragraph, the lines of a Code block are literally interpreted.

Here's an example:

```
This is a Code block
```

To create a Code block in Markdown, we must indent each line of it with at least 4 spaces or one tab.


For example:

```
This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a Code block. 
```

You can also create a separated Code block with:

    ```

### Inline Code block

Inline Code blocks can be written using:`

For example:

    This is 'an inline code block'

### Syntax highlighting

You can define the used language to highlight the syntax by adding a name to an open keyword. Example:

    ```js
    var a = {};
    ```
